# Contributing to FMICodeGenerator

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to FMICodeGenerator, its scripts and template code. I try to keep it brief, so here's the idea in a nutshell.

## License

The FMICodeGenerator is provided under a *BSD 3-Clause License*. By contributing code/wiki/documentation content, you agree to place your contribution unter the same license. This will ensure, that the entire FMICodeGeneator project remains a free and open-source project.

## Coding Style

The FMICodeGenerator project used Python code (with PyQt for GUI components) and, as a code generator, produces C/C++ code based on various template files. Instead of writing a fixed style guide here, I'd be happy if you would simply try to write your contribution in a similar manner as the existing code. I hope you don't mind if it happends that I adjust the coding style of contributed code a litte.

That's all :-)

Happy coding!
